In the repository https://github.com/BruceEckel/markdown_tools, 
in the file src\markdown_tools\markdown_file.py, 


In the following file, I would like to refactor
the parser in the MarkdownFile constructor as follows:

1. Add a generator function parse_markdown(source: List[str]) that takes
a list of the lines from the original file, and yields 
MarkdownText | SourceCode | CodePath

2. Assume there is no nesting of MarkdownText, SourceCode, or CodePath within
each other.

3. parse_markdown keeps track of the line number it is processing. When it encounters 
the beginning of a new type, it passes 'source' and the line number to the constructor for that
type, which will absorb all the lines necessary to complete that type. That constructor will
return a tuple containing the newly-created object of that type, and the new line number representing
the next line of 'source' after the lines necessary to create that type. parse_markdown can
then continue processing using the new line number.

4. If a SourceCode encounters either the end of the file or an opening 
SourceCode marker before a closing SourceCode marker, report an error.

5. If a CodePath encounters the end of the file before a closing Markdown comment marker, 
report an error.

Please provide the complete listing.
